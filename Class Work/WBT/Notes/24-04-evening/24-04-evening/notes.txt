JavaScript: JS is for providing functionality to the web page at the client side 

Client side scripting 
logics that are executed at the client side (browser)

For JS we don't have compiler

For js only the interpreter is there i.e. JS Engine

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    

    <script>
        
    </script>
</body>
</html>


for JS everything is an object
web page is an object
image is an object
every tag is also an object
browser window is an object

some of the predefined objects:

document -> this object represents the entire web page
window -> this object represents the browser's window 
console -> this object represents the inspect window console
with the help of this object we can log some messages on the console

as a developer we don't need to declare these objects, as they are already defined 


document.write("Hello World");
window.alert("Hello Alert");

alert();

note: the properties of window object can be accessed directly without window. (without calling them on window object with member access operator)

console.log("hello developers");

document.write("Hello World");
        alert("Hello Alert");
        console.log("hello developers");

variables

x=6;
developer can't decide the data type for variables 
data types do exists but they are assigned at the runtime by looking at the value assigned

in JS we only have a single type for numeric values i.e "number"

in JS variables can change their type as well:
x = 6;
console.log(typeof x);
x = "hello";
console.log(typeof x);

js is not a type safe lang

TS -> compiler -> js 

in js we don't have a separate type for character as we have in java and c c++
