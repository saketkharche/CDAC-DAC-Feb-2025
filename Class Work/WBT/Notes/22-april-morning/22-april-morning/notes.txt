Web apps development

How web app works

1. Client
2. Server

Noodles

Restaurant-> Server 
Customer -> client


Web app-> live 

ip address : unique address of a device on a network

192.168.10.13.1


host a web app
domain name : flipkart.com, amazon.in

Server & client

Server is just another computer system

Its the server on which a web app will be executing
Server will be containing your entire application


Browser send a request to server (client)
Server -> will accept and process the request, once processing is done then 
it will send a response 

development on local machine -> host the app on server 

end users -> browser -> server 

Development:
Two aspects are there for web development:
1. Frontend: UI -> display 
   
   HTML: structure a web page 
	HTML is used to display data into web page 
	
   CSS : will style a web page
   JS:  to perform operations onto the client side/browser 
   livescript

   React, Angular, Vue, 
  

2. Backend : Database -> store the data 
	     Processing of the data 

   Database: MySQL, mongodb, postgre, sql server, Cassandra, etc
   Process the data: JavaScript
   Node js is an interpreter 
   Express 


Registration form:


Frontend: write logic to display form with input fields, and one submit button
Backend: process the data -> store into database -> send a response to the client 

Login Form:

Frontend: to display the fields for username password and button
Backend: validation of the received username and password 
from request with the db username and password 




Eery browser is having one component that executes the js code: JS Engine

interpreter executes the code 

google chrome: v8 engine
firefox: spydermonkey


MongoDb/MySQL -> M
Express -> E
React -> R/A
Node Js -> N

MERN 
MEAN


Technical Specifications of Request and Response:

Regardless of the technology we are using to develop backend, the specification is going to
remain the same 
W3C has designed all the specs for request and response 

Specs for request:

1. We need a url to send a request (endpoint)
2. mention the purpose for sending the request
   w3c has created certain request methods : GET POST PUT DELETE PATCH 
   if we haven't specified any request method explicitly then GET will be considered by default
   
ip address

myapp.com -> translated into ip address DNS
