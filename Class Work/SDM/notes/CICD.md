##  **Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery with Jenkins**

“Alright team, today we’re stepping into something that will completely change how you build and deliver software — something called **CI/CD**. Think of it as setting up an automated assembly line for your code: as soon as you write it, tests are run, builds are created, and deployments happen automatically. Like magic? Almost. But it’s really just smart automation.”


### 🚦 **Continuous Integration (CI): The First Line of Defense**

Let me tell you a story: 20 years ago, developers worked in silos for weeks or even months before merging their code. When they finally integrated it, it often broke everything. This painful experience was called **integration hell** — developers spent days or weeks fixing incompatibilities instead of building features.

That’s why **Continuous Integration**, or CI, was born. It’s simple in idea but powerful in practice: every time you or any team member commits code, your CI system **immediately builds and tests** the latest version of the software. If something breaks, the team knows instantly — not weeks later.

I remember when Gary Booch first coined the term *Continuous Integration* — it changed how teams approached software. Instead of waiting, you integrate early and often. The result? Faster feedback, happier developers, and way fewer late-night debugging sessions.

**CI covers the first part of the pipeline:**
- ✅ Detect changes
- ✅ Analyze source code quality
- ✅ Build the application
- ✅ Run unit & integration tests
- ✅ Generate deployable artifacts
- ✅ Report results instantly

**If any step fails?** Integration stops and everyone’s notified. Mistakes are caught early — before they grow into disasters.


### 🚀 **Continuous Delivery (CD): Carrying the Torch Beyond CI**

Now, imagine our code has passed CI checks. The next step is making sure it actually **gets to the users** safely and reliably. That’s where **Continuous Delivery (CD)** comes in.

Where CI stops at building and testing, CD **automates the path to deployment**. CD takes the tested code, pushes it through environments like staging and QA, runs system-level and acceptance tests, and gets it ready for production.

In the real world, I’ve seen companies reduce release cycles from once every few months to multiple times a day because they embraced CI/CD.


### 🔄 **The CI/CD Phases at a Glance**

I always tell my mentees to think of the pipeline like a relay race:

* **Phase 1: Commit** – Developer writes and pushes code.
* **Phase 2: Build** – Code is compiled and packaged.
* **Phase 3: Test Automation** – Automated tests ensure quality.
* **Phase 4: Deploy** – Code moves to staging or production.

CI covers Commit + Build.
CD picks up at automated testing and carries through to deployment.


### 🛠️ **Why Jenkins?**

Let’s talk tools — and one tool that’s stood the test of time: **Jenkins**.

When I first discovered Jenkins in 2011, it felt like a game-changer. It’s open-source, extensible, and can connect to almost anything thanks to hundreds of plugins. Whether you use GitHub, Docker, Maven, or Kubernetes — Jenkins probably has a plugin for it.

Here’s why I always recommend Jenkins for beginners and professionals alike:

- ✅ **Costs:** It’s free. You don’t have to beg management for budget approvals — start automating today.
- ✅ **Plugins:** Jenkins’ plugin ecosystem is like a Swiss Army knife; whatever cloud provider or technology you use, there’s a plugin for it.
- ✅ **Open Source:** Thousands of developers contribute, meaning Jenkins evolves with the industry.

And unlike many cloud-only tools, Jenkins can run anywhere — your laptop, on-prem servers, or the cloud.


### 🔗 **How Jenkins Integrates with GitHub**

Here’s something magical: Jenkins and GitHub can talk to each other. Every time you push a commit, GitHub can **trigger Jenkins automatically**, which starts your CI/CD pipeline. Jenkins will:

* Pull your latest code,
* Run your build and tests,
* Package your app,
* Even deploy it if tests pass.

This **bi-directional integration** lets your DevOps workflow run without you manually pressing buttons.


### 🔥 **Hands-on: Configuring Your First CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins & GitHub**

Let’s set it up together — step by step:

1️⃣ **Install Jenkins**

* Spin up a Jenkins server on your machine or cloud VM (like EC2).
* Access it via your browser at `http://<server-ip>:8080`.

2️⃣ **Install Key Plugins**

* Git Plugin
* Pipeline Plugin
* Blue Ocean (for a modern UI)

3️⃣ **Connect to GitHub**

* Generate a GitHub personal access token.
* In Jenkins, add credentials for GitHub.
* Create a new Jenkins job (Freestyle or Pipeline) connected to your GitHub repo.

4️⃣ **Configure Webhook in GitHub**

* Go to your repo’s settings → Webhooks.
* Add your Jenkins URL: `http://<jenkins-url>/github-webhook/`.

5️⃣ **Create a Pipeline Script (`Jenkinsfile`)** in your GitHub repo:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git'
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'npm install'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'npm test'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'npm run deploy'  // Replace with your deploy command
            }
        }
    }
}
```

6️⃣ **Trigger Your Pipeline**

* Push code to GitHub.
* GitHub webhook notifies Jenkins.
* Jenkins runs the pipeline: checkout → build → test → deploy.

Congratulations, you’ve just automated your development workflow end-to-end!

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery

Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) is a holistic DevOps process that focuses on creating a compatible blend between the development cycle and the operations process. This is done by automating workflows and rolling out automatic updates to improve ROI. The CI/CD pipeline implementation is the backbone of the entire DevOps paradigm and facilitates the process of introducing the product to the marketplace faster than ever before. 


### Continuous Integration(CI)

Continuous Integration(CI), which was first proposed as a term by Gary Booch, integrates the source code with the repository. This facilitates the developers to carry out the development process in a quick and sophisticated manner.

CI is not entirely an essential prerequisite required for creating a stable software product. However, it definitely serves an important role when developing software products or components that require frequent changes. Furthermore, it also ensures that all the components of an application are integrated properly. 

Continuous Integration is a software development method where team members integrate their work at least once a day. In this method, every integration is checked by an automated build to detect errors. This concept was first introduced over two decades ago to avoid “integration hell,” which happens when integration is put off till the end of a project.

In Continuous Integration after a code commit, the software is built and tested immediately. In a large project with many developers, commits are made many times during a day. With each commit code is built and tested. If the test is passed, build is tested for deployment. If the deployment is a success, the code is pushed to Production. This commit, build, test, and deploy is a continuous process, and hence the name continuous integration/deployment.

In the SDLC, CI mainly covers the Source and Build phases. A CI pipeline typically involves these steps:      

.Detect changes in the code 
.Analyze the quality of the source code
.Build
.Execute all unit tests
.Execute all integration tests
.Generate deployable artifacts
.Report status

If any of the above steps fail, the integration stops immediately, and the team is notified about the result. 

### Continuous Delivery(CD)

Continuous Delivery (CD), on the other hand, is a set of software development practices that ensures the deployment of code to production while performing efficient testing in the process. Precisely speaking, CD starts where CI ends. Continuous Delivery is responsible for pushing the code to the testing environment where different tests such as system testing, unit testing, and integration testing are performed.

A typical CI/CD pipeline works in 4 phases that are listed below:       

- Phase 1: Commit - This is the actual phase where developers commit changes to the code.
- Phase 2: Build – In this phase, the source code is integrated into the build from the repository. 
- Phase 3: Test Automation - This step is an integral part of any CI/CD pipeline. The source code previously integrated into the build is subjected to a systematic cycle of testing.  
- Phase 4: Deploy - The tested version is finally sent for deployment in this phase.

While Continuous Integration covers the commit and build stages, Continuous Delivery, on the other hand, ensures the process automation as well as testing till the deployment phase.

### How Do You Create Your CI/CD Pipeline With Jenkins?

Jenkins is one of the most widely used open-source CI/CD DevOps tools. It enables developers to implement CI/CD pipelines within the development environment in a comprehensive manner. Jenkins is written in Java and supports various version control tools including Git and Maven.

Its popularity is based on the fact that Jenkins is an open source repository of rich integrations and plugins that are well documented and extensible, based on an extended community of developers who have developed hundreds of plugins to accomplish almost any task. 

Jenkins runs on the server and requires constant maintenance and updates. The availability of Jenkins as a cross-platform tool for Windows, Linux, and various operating systems makes it stand out among other DevOps tools. Moreover, it can easily be configured using CLI or GUI.

#### Why Use CI/CD with Jenkins?

The list of benefits of using CI/CD with Jenkins is a detailed one. The three main ones are:

1. Costs
While implementing CI/CD with Jenkins, developers and the DevOps team don’t need to worry about the additional procurement costs involved in setting up code pipelines, as Jenkins is free and open source. This simply means that they no longer have to get spending approval from management. As far as cloud and infrastructure costs are concerned, these costs can be optimized as well by efficiently utilizing the resources available and implementing the Infrastructure as Code (IAC) approach using Jenkins. 

2. Plugins
Another remarkable feature that highlights Jenkins’ value is the extended variety of Jenkins plugins available in Jenkins. With this diverse range, users of different cloud providers can feasibly utilize CI processes via Jenkins in a significantly lesser time. Moreover, Jenkins also provides a default list of common tools and services that can be implemented either on-premises or on the cloud. Top Jenkins plugins include Dashboard View, Test Analysis Plugins, and Build Pipeline Plugins.

3. Open Source
Jenkins, with its long history of CI/CD practices, was introduced in the year 2011. Its availability on the open-source platform provides it an edge over other tools used for the same purpose. Numerous developers, community contributors, and users actively participate in the open-source platform to maintain Jenkin’s functionality as an open-source product.

#### Configuring Automated CI/CD with Jenkins & GitHub — Step by Step

Configuring automated CI/CD with Jenkins and GitHub is a simple and straightforward process and can help automate the entire workflow. Integrating Jenkins with GitHub enables the developers to pull the source code from any Git repository in a hassle-free manner.

Furthermore, GitHub also supports bi-directional integration, which will automatically initiate a trigger to Jenkins every time there is a change in the GitHub repository.

DevOps is an ever-evolving ecosystem in the development industry, and the CI/CD tools in this domain are highly critical. CI/CD practices effectively handle the misalignment between developers and the operational team. There are several tools built for this purpose in the marketplace today, but Jenkins holds an established position in the industry as well as a promising future ahead of it because of its open-source benefits and a wide range of plugins. Furthermore, it integrates well with GitHub allowing productivity and flexibility in the DevOps cycle.
