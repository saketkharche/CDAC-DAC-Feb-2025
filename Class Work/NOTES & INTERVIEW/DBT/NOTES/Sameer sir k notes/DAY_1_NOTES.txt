1} origin of the word computer -> computare (Latin word) -> to compute/ calculate

2} Charles babage was a mathematician . He invented the first computer(aka difference engine)

			    (INPUT)			      (OUTPUT)
3} job of a computer ---->   Data   -->>   computer    -->> information
			    (Raw facts)			   (Meaningful data)
							   (processed data)

4} Data====> data on whose basis the Management can take some decision or you can perform 	some action

5} Processing===> work done by the computer to convert data into information.

6} Database===>	collection of large amounts of data.

7} DBMS===> Data base management system
       ===> readymade software that you to manage your data.
       ===> ANSI definition for DBMS--> collection of programs.
       ===> function: Insert, update, delete, and process
       ===> Various DBMS available:- MS Excel, dBase, FoxBASE, FoxPro(from fox system), Clipper(used by 		Union Bank of India) Dataease, Dataflex, Advanced Revelation, DB Vista, Quattro(from 			 borland), Lotus 1-2-3 etc.
      ====> MS Excel program --> is known as a Macro (VBA programming)
      ====> 53% work 

8} MySQL --> DBMS (Relational Database Management system)
7} Oracle --> RDBMS + ODDBMS (obj. oriented DBMS) --> ORDBMS(Obj. relational DBMS)  
	e.g., MS Excel
9} DBMS e.g., MS Excel, Foxpro, etc
10} RDMS e.g., MySQL, Oracle, Postgress, etc.

DIFFRENCE B/T BOTH:

1} Naming Conventions are different (Nomenclature).
2} Relationship between 2 files is maintained programmatically in DBMS BUT!! Relationship between 2 tables can be specified at the time of table.
3} More Time is required for S/W development in DBMS BUT!!! Less time is required for S/W development
 in RDBMS 
4} More Programming in DBMS BUT!!! Less Programming.
5} High Network Traffic in DBMS BUT!!! Low network Traffic in RDBMS
6} Processing is on client machine in DBMS BUT!!! Processing is on
7 DBMS if slow and expensive BUT!!!! RDBMS is Faster in terms of network traffic and Cheaper in terms of 	hardware cost, network, platform cost, infrastructure cost
8} Client Server Architecture is not supported in DMBS BUT!!!! Most of RDMS support client server 	architecture cost 
9} In DBMS We have File Level locking but in RDBMS we have row level locking
10} DBMS is Not Suitable for multi-User S/W RDBMS is Suitable for muti user.
11} Distributed Databases are not supported in DBMS BUT!!! Most of the RDMS supports 	distributed databases(exception MS access as it is weak RDBMS).
12} No security of data in DBMS BUT!!!! Multiple levels of security in RDBMS some of them are:
						---->a} logging in security:-
							(MySQL DataBase Username and PassWord)

						---->b} command level security:
							(Privilege to give certain MySQL commands, 							e.g., CREATE TABLE, CREATE 									PROCEDURE,  )

						---->c} Object level security:
							(to access the table of other users)



IMP: Table is not a file; Internally Every Row is A file in RDBMS

1} DISTRIBUTED DATABASES: -- Each and every databases are doing operations on each others 				      databases.

File system given by MySQL:
i} NTFS: 
ii} OFS:


VARIOUS RDMS:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Oracle: works on 113 OS
----------------------------------
*Sybase: going down
	recently acquire by SAP
---------------------------------
*MS SQL Server:
		Good RDBMS from Microsoft
		works only with Windows OS no other OS
		16%  
	->single user version of oracle:- Personal Oracle(has all the features)
---------------------------------

Some of the open source RDBMS:

*Ingres
*Postgres(currently CDAC is also using this)
*Unify : 
---------------------------------------

-DATA BASE SERVER HAS TO BE A MAINFRAME(SUPER COMPUTER):-(min 1600 gb RAM)
DB2: good RDBMS from IBM 
----------------------------------------

Single user RDMS (PC Based):-
 
Paradox: MS Access
Vatcom SQL:
---------------------------------------
MYSQL:  -Was Launched by Swedish company in 1995.
	-its name is a combination of "My" the name of co-founder Michael Widenius' 		 daughter, and "SQL"
	-MySQL is open source RDBMS
	-Most widely used open source RDBMS(42% of world open source database market)
	-free S/W open Source projects that require a full featured data base management 	  system often use MySQL.
	-Facebook, PayPal, Youtube, LinkedIn, Twitter, ebay, CISCO, Verizon, Uber, Shopify, 		NETFLIX, GitHub, WalMart, Booking.com, Zappos.com, Bank of America, 			 Flipkart, Paytm, Google(though not for searches but to store any 			  contancts Also for searching it uses Bigtable(every column is a file)).
		   Joomla, WordPress, Flickr, etc
	-Part of the widely used LAMP open Source web application s/w stack(and other "AMP" 	  stacks)
L Linux			WAMP-> windows AMP
A Apache		MAMP-> MaxOSAMP
M MySQL			XAMP-> X-WindowsAMP
P Perl or PHP 			

	Sun microsystems acquired MySQL in 2008
	Oracle acquired sun microsystem in 2010
	why MySQL symbol is dolphine---> as it is user friendly 




Various software dev tools:
1 MySQL database
2 MySQL-pl:---->used for database programming
		MySQL programming language
		used for database programming, e.g., HRA_CALC, TAX_CALC, ATTENDANCE_CALC, 			etc
		
3 MySQL command line client:-----> it is client S/W
				   run SQL commands, MySQL commands, and MySQL-PL programs
				   front-end s/w
				   job of front-end s/w input and output
				   Character Based(text based)
				    
					



4 MySQL Workbench -------->it is client S/W
			   run SQL commands, MySQL commands, and MySQL-PL programs
			   front-end s/w
			   job of front-end s/w input and output
			   GUI Based(graphical user interface )

5 MySQL Connectors
6 MySQL for Excel
7 MySQL Notifier
8 MySQL Enterprise Backup:----> used to copy table data
				used to backups of tables and restore from the backups.
				Export and Import of tables
				used to transport the tables from one data base to another 				 data base.
				

9 MySQL Enterprise High Availabilty
10 MySQL Enterprise Encryption
11 MySQL Enterprise Monitor
12 MySQL Query Analyzer
etc.



DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL 


1 ===>  -MYSQL Strutured Query language
	-Conforms to ANSI standards(e.g., 1 char =1 byte of storage)
	-Conforms to ISO standards(for QA)
	-not a product of MySQL
	-all commands for common for all RDBMS 
	-create, update, alter, insert, delete, grant, revoke, select.
	-Initially founded by IBM(1975-77) 
	-SOURCE CODE OF SQL (C,C++ -->90%  and Assembly language-->10%)
	-initially SQL was known as RQBE (Relational query by example) 
	-IBM gave RQBE free of cost to ANSI
	-ANSI renamed RQBE to SQL.
	-SQL is now controlled by ANSI (and hence SQL is common for all RDBMS).
	-in 2005, ANSI rewrote the source code of SQL in java(100% java)
