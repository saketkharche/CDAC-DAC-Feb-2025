Advanced Hibernate 
Inheritance
Associations between entities.



Enter Advanced Hibernate (Project objective)

Inheritance in JPA/Hibernate
It supports 4 inheritance strategies , to enhance re usability , in the entity layer

First inheritance strategy : 
1.Annotation : jakarta.persistence.MappedSuperclass
Class level annotation , to be added on abstract or concrete super class
Hibernate will NOT generate any table for it.
One can add all common fields in this class
All other entities can extend n inherit from the common super class

Which are typically required common members  ?
ID related 
creation date / time / time stamp
update date / time / time stamp
Refer -  @CreationTimestamp , @UpdateTimeStamp - supplied by hibernate
@Version related (later can be added for optimistic locking)


2. Associations between Entities (HAS-A) : weaker form of association => aggregation (since Entities have a standalone life cycle , have a separate DB  Identity in form of a seaprate table n it's  PK)

Ref : Food Delivery App
Can One Restaurant serve multiple food items ?


2.1 Establish bi dir , one->many n many->one association between the entities.
Restaurant 1<----->* FooItem
eg : FooItem n Restaurant
Details -
Restaurant - 
private String name;
private String address;
private String city;
private String description;


Food Item -

private String itemName;
private String itemDescription;
private boolean isVeg;
private int price;




FoodItem : child , many, owning ( since it contains FK column)
Restaurant : parent , one , non-owning(inverse)

Technical terms : parent/child , one side/many , (non-owning)inverse side/owning

owning side of the association -
 The side which contains the FK (physical mapping)
non owning(inverse) side of the asso -
The side which DOES NOT conatain the FK 


2 Types of associations 
uni directional
OR
bi directional

Directionality concept exists ONLY in Object world

Uni directional association : the one in which you can navigate only from 1 side to another.
Another eg : Course 1----->* Student

Bi directional association : you can navigate the association from any side.

eg : Course 1<----->*   Student 


How To configure a Bi dir relationship?

eg : Restaurant 1 <------> * FooItem
(Bi dir relationship , one to many n many to one) 

Restaurant : one , parent , non owning

FoodItem : many , child , owning (contains FK Restaurant_id ---> PK of depts table)

Steps 
Configure Entities 
1. Restaurant : extends BaseEntity
Fields : name, address,city,description;
+private List<FooItem> foodItems=new ArrayList<>();

As per Gavin King's suggestion always initialize collection based property to empty collection (to avoid NullPointerException. while adding /removing the child elements)
generate : setters n getters.

2. FoodItem : extends BaseEntity
Fields : itemName,itemDescription,isVeg,price;
 +
private Restaurant chosenRestaurant;
Add setter n getter

Problems n solutions

1.What will happen if you don't add any association mapping annotations?
Observation : org.hibernate.MappingException is thrown !
Why ?  Hibernate CAN NOT figure out the type of association , between the entities.
Solution : Add mapping annotation .

JPA Annotations for E-R
@OneToOne
@ManyToOne
@OneToMany
@ManyToMany



2. After adding @ManyToOne n @OneToMany , no MappingException.
BUT how many tables were created by hibernate ?  3 (eg : categories,posts,categories_posts)

Is the link table  really required for establishing one to many bi dir asso ? NO
Simpler way : FK


3. Reason behind additional table : Hibernate can't identify which is owning n inverse side of the association

Solution : In a bi dir association : It's mandatory to   add mappedBy : property 
in @OneToMany .
 
Which side should it appear : inverse(eg : Restaurant)
What should be the value of mappedBy = Name of the association property , as it appears in the owning side
eg : In Restaurant class : add
@OneToMany(mappedBy = "chosenRestaurant")
private List<FooItem> empList = new ArrayList<>();

4. How to customize name n not null constraint of FK column ?
eg : 
@JoinColumn(name="Restaurant_id")//optional BUT recommended
private Restaurant chosenRestaurant;


5. Project Tip (suggestion from Gavin King)
In case of bi-dir associations , instead of adding complex logic in DAO or Tester ,
Add helper methods in the POJO layer itself 
1. To add child entity
2. To remove a child entity
eg : In Restaurant class ,
addBlog n removeBlog




Objectives 
1. Add a new Restaurant 
i/p : name , description
o/p : mesg


2. Add a food item under specified Restaurant
i/p :food item details +Restaurant id 
o/p : mesg
Steps in FoodItem  DAO
Method declaration - String addNewFoodItem(Long restaurantId, FooItem item);

2.1 get Restaurant from it's id - get
2.2 valid Restaurant - 
c1.addFoodItem(post);
session.persist(post);


Will you have to explicitly call : session.persist(foodItem) ? 

Any simpler solution ? YES 
Use cascade option

Cascading in JPA / Hibernate , refers to the ability to automatically propagate the state of an entity  across associations between entities. 

eg , In current scenario , if Restaurant is deleted , since it has  a one-to-many relationship with FooItem , you can define cascading to specify that when a Restaurant is deleted, all of it's blog posts should be deleted as well. Or saved or updated.

Cascading in Hibernate refers to the automatic persistence of related entities. 

When a change is made to an entity, such as an save /update or delete the changes can be cascaded to related entities as well. 

Cascading can be configured using annotations

jakarta.persistence.CascadeType : enum 
Values :  ALL,PERSIST, MERGE, REMOVE, REFRESH, DETACH

Solution : Add a cascade type.
eg : @OneToMany (mappedBy = "chosenRestaurant",cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
      private List<FooItem> posts=new ArrayList<>();



2.6 Delete Restaurant details (lab work)
i/p : Restaurant name  (unique)
o/p mesg
DB action - child recs should be deleted first(food items) n then the parent record(Restaurant)

(Test the effect of cascade on delete)
Hint - In RestaurantDaoImpl
JPQL + getSingleResult
session.remove(Restaurant);
commit



3. Remove food item from the given Restaurant
i/p - food item id , Restaurant id 
o/p - mesg
DB action - rec should be deleted from food_items table


Problem : When you try to remove a child from the parent(using removeFooItem)
Hibernate will simply nullify the FK (firing update query) BUT will NOT delete the record .
Reason : Not yet specified orphanRemoval property to hibernate.

6. Set orphanRemoval=true on the Parent-Side


Setting orphanRemoval on the parent-side guarantees the removal of children without references. 
It is good for cleaning up practice for dependent objects that should not exist without a reference from an owner object. 


orphanRemoval : a property of @OneToMany
(Optional) Whether to apply the remove operation to entities that have been removed from the relationship and to cascade the remove operation to those entities.


7. Try to access Restaurant details , using it's name
Print Restaurant details n it's blog post  details .

Problem : org.hibernate.LazyInitializationException

WHY ?

JPA/Hibernate follows default fetching policies for different types of associations
one-to-one : EAGER
one-to-many : LAZY
many-to-one : EAGER
many-to-many : LAZY


one-to-many : LAZY
Meaning : If you try to fetch details of one side(eg : Restaurant) , will it fetch auto details of many side(blog posts) ?
NO (i.e select query will be fired only on Restaurants table)
Why ? : for better performance 

When will hibernate throw org.hibernate.LazyInitializationException ?
Any time you are trying to access un-fetched data from DB(represented by a proxy) , in a detached manner(outside the session scope)
Triggers  : one-to-many
many-many
session's load method

un fetched data : i.e emp list in  Restaurant obj : represented by : proxy (substitution) : proxy object representing a collection 
proxy => un fetched data from DB

Solutions
1. Change the fetching policy of hibernate for one-to-many to : EAGER
eg : 
@OneToMany(mappedBy = "myRestaurant",cascade = CascadeType.ALL,orphanRemoval=true,fetch=FetchType.EAGER)  
	private List<FoodItem> foodItems=new ArrayList<>();

Is it recommneded soln : NO (since even if you just want to access one side details , hibernate will fire query on many side) --will lead to worst performance.
Use Case : when the size of many is small 

OR
2.
 @OneToMany(mappedBy = "myRestaurant",cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
	private List<FooItem> emps=new ArrayList<>();
Solution : Simply access the size of the collection within session scope :  This soln will be applied in DAO layer
Dis Adv : Hibernate fires multiple queries to get the complete details

OR 
3. Most recommended soln to avoid select n+1 issue : 
How to fetch the complete details , in a single join query ?
Using "join fetch" keyword in JPQL
String jpql =....

Hibernate will fire SINGLE INNER JOIN  query to fetch Restaurant n blog post  details (not resulting in LazyInitializationException)	


Another trigger for lazy init exception 
: Session's API 
load.


2 triggers
1.Any-To-Many(one-many n many-many) --hibernate rets collection of proxies
2.Session's load method ---hibernate rets single proxy.


8. get vs load

9. Proceed to one-to-one 
one-one uni directional association between User n Address
User 1-->1 Address
How will you configure ?
Will you use cascading ?

9.1 Assign user address
i/p -- adress details + user id

9.2 Lab work
Get user details along with it's address
i/p - user email
o/p -- user +adress detail


9.3 List all user names from a specified city
i/p city name
o/p -- list of users(names)

10. Many -Many
