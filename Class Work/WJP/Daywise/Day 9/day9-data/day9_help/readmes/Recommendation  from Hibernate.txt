Recommendation  from Hibernate 
Ideally use id property - only for HBM(hibenrnate mapping) purpose

What should be typically the data type of unique ID property ?
int / Integer
long / Long

Ans - use wrapper types (reference type)
default value of the ref type - null

Hibernate uses null checking to find out whether entity is transient or persistent.
It may be confusing to hibernate if you use int/long 
since their def value - 0 
(i.e  hibernate might think of the entity as persistent with id=0 , causing problems)

Entity class must have 
-  default constructor
-  all getters n setters 
for Hibernate to manage persistence correctly.
