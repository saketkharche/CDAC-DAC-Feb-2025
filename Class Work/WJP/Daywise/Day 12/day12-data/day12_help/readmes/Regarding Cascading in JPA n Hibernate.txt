What is Cascading ?

It refers to the ability to automatically propagate the state of an entity  across associations between entities. 

Hibernate cascading is a powerful feature that simplifies the management of complex E-R within a persistence context. 

It allows you to automatically propagate certain  operations (like saving, updating, and deleting) to associated entities, reducing the boilerplate  code .

How 
When you define a relationship between two entities(Category --- BlogPost) and specify a cascade type, Hibernate will automatically perform the specified operation on the related entities when you perform that operation on the parent entity.

Types of Cascading options via CascadeType enum.
jakarta.persistence.CascadeType : enum 
Values :  ALL,PERSIST, MERGE, REMOVE, REFRESH, DETACH

  CascadeType.PERSIST:
   Use case - When you want to persist a new parent entity and its associated child entities in a single transaction. 
 CascadeType.MERGE:
   Use Case: When you want to update an existing parent entity and its associated child entities in a single transaction.
    CascadeType.REMOVE:
   Use Case: When you want to delete a parent entity and its associated child entities in a single transaction.
    CascadeType.REFRESH:
   Use Case: When you want to refresh the state of a parent entity and its associated child entities from the database.
    CascadeType.ALL:
   Use Case: When you want to apply all of the above cascade types to the E-R
 
eg - Category 1<--->* BlogPost

To cascade  save , update ,delete operations from Category to BlogPost


Solution : @OneToMany (mappedBy = "chosenCategory",cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
private List<BlogPost> posts=new ArrayList<>();
