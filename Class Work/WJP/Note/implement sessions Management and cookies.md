# Session Management and Cookies in Java Web Applications

## 📌 Introduction
HTTP is a **stateless protocol**, meaning the server cannot distinguish between multiple requests from the same client. To maintain state across HTTP requests, **Session Management** techniques like **Cookies**, **URL Rewriting**, **Hidden Form Fields**, and **HttpSession API** are used.

## 🔐 1. What is a Session?
A **session** is a sequence of interactions between a client (browser) and a server during a single visit to a web application.

- **Session ID**: A unique identifier assigned by the server to identify each session.
- **Purpose**: To store user-specific data (e.g., login info, preferences) across multiple requests.

## 🍪 2. Cookies

### ✅ Definition:
A **cookie** is a small piece of data sent from the server to the client's browser, which is stored on the client side and sent back with subsequent requests.

### ⚙️ How Cookies Work:
1. Server sends a cookie to the client via `Set-Cookie` header.
2. Browser stores it and sends it back in future requests.
3. Server uses this cookie to recognize the client.

### 🧩 Cookie Class:
```java
Cookie myCookie = new Cookie("username", "john_doe");
response.addCookie(myCookie);
```

### ⏱️ Setting Expiry Time:
```java
myCookie.setMaxAge(60 * 60); // 1 hour
```

### 🟢 Advantages:
- Simple and easy to use.
- No server-side memory required.
- Persistent cookies survive browser restarts.

### 🔴 Disadvantages:
- Stored as plain text → **security risk**.
- Users can disable cookies in browser settings.
- Limited size (~4 KB per cookie).

## 🧠 HttpSession API

### ✅ Definition:
`HttpSession` is a server-side mechanism to track user sessions across multiple requests.

### ⚙️ How It Works:
1. On first request, server creates a session object and assigns a unique `JSESSIONID`.
2. This ID is passed to the client using cookies or URL rewriting.
3. Client sends the session ID back in every subsequent request.

### 🧩 Using HttpSession:
```java
HttpSession session = request.getSession();
session.setAttribute("user", userObject);
```

### 📦 Storing Data:
```java
session.setAttribute("key", value); // Store
User user = (User) session.getAttribute("user"); // Retrieve
session.invalidate(); // Destroy session
```

### 🟢 Advantages:
- Secure: Data stored on server.
- Can store complex objects.
- Built-in support in Servlet/JSP.

### 🔴 Disadvantages:
- Consumes server memory for large applications.
- Needs proper session timeout configuration.

## 🛡️ Preventing Caching in JSP Pages
To avoid sensitive data being cached by browsers:

```jsp
<% 
    response.setHeader("Cache-Control", "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"); // HTTP 1.1
    response.setHeader("Pragma", "no-cache"); // HTTP 1.0
    response.setDateHeader("Expires", 0); // Proxies
%>
```

## 🧾 Example: Using Cookies in Servlet

```java
// Create and send a cookie
Cookie cookie = new Cookie("theme", "dark");
cookie.setMaxAge(60 * 60 * 24); // 1 day
response.addCookie(cookie);

// Read a cookie
Cookie[] cookies = request.getCookies();
if (cookies != null) {
    for (Cookie c : cookies) {
        if ("theme".equals(c.getName())) {
            out.print("Theme: " + c.getValue());
        }
    }
}
```

---

## 🧾 Example: Using HttpSession in Servlet

```java
HttpSession session = request.getSession();
session.setAttribute("user", user); // Store user object

// Access session attribute in another servlet
User user = (User) session.getAttribute("user");

// Invalidate session (logout)
session.invalidate();
```

---

## 🧩 JSP Implicit Session Object

In JSP, the `session` object is available by default:

```jsp
<%@ page session="true" %>
<%
    session.setAttribute("user", user);
    out.println(session.getAttribute("user"));
%>
```

> ⚠️ You can disable session creation in JSP using `<%@ page session="false" %>`

## 🔄 Session Management Techniques Summary

| Technique         | Description                                  | Pros                         | Cons                          |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Cookies**       | Small data stored on client                  | Lightweight, persistent      | Insecure, limited size        |
| **HttpSession**   | Server-side session management               | Secure, supports complex data| Memory usage, scalability     |
| **URL Rewriting** | Session ID appended to URLs                  | Works when cookies disabled  | Ugly URLs, not SEO-friendly   |
| **Hidden Form Fields** | Hidden fields in forms                   | Works without cookies        | Not dynamic, hard to manage   |

## 🧪 Best Practices

- Use **HttpSession** for storing sensitive or complex data.
- Use **Cookies** only for non-sensitive, small data.
- Always set an appropriate **session timeout**.
- Disable session in JSP pages where not needed.
- Encrypt sensitive cookie values before sending them.
- Use **Secure** and **HttpOnly** flags for cookies in production.

```xml
<!-- web.xml -->
<session-config>
    <session-timeout>30</session-timeout> <!-- in minutes -->
</session-config>
```

## 📝 Conclusion

Session management is essential in web development to maintain state in a stateless environment like HTTP. While **cookies** are lightweight and easy to implement, they lack security and scalability. The **HttpSession API** provides a more robust and secure way to handle sessions but requires careful memory and timeout management.

Choose the right technique based on your application’s needs!

✅ **Use Cases**:
- **Login system** → Use `HttpSession`
- **User preference storage** → Use cookies
- **Analytics tracking** → Use cookies
- **Shopping cart** → Use `HttpSession` or database-backed session
