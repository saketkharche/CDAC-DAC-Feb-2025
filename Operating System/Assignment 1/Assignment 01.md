### Problem 1: Read the instructions carefully and answer accordingly. If there is any need to insert some data then do that as well.

a) Navigate and List:
a. Start by navigating to your home directory and list its contents. Then, move into a
directory named "LinuxAssignment" if it exists; otherwise, create it.
Ans:- 
`cdac@Saket:~$ pwd`
`/home/cdac`
`cdac@Saket:~$ cd`
`cdac@Saket:~$ ls`
`Feb25`
`cdac@Saket:~$ mkdir LinuxAssignment`
`cdac@Saket:~$ ls`
`Feb25  LinuxAssignment`
`cdac@Saket:~$ cd LinuxAssignment/`
`cdac@Saket:~/LinuxAssignment$`
![[Screenshot (187).png]]

b) File Management:
a. Inside the "LinuxAssignment" directory, create a new file named "file1.txt". Display its contents.
Ans:-
`cdac@Saket:~/LinuxAssignment$ touch file1.txt`
`cdac@Saket:~/LinuxAssignment$ ls`
`file1.txt`
`cdac@Saket:~/LinuxAssignment$ nano file1.txt`
`cdac@Saket:~/LinuxAssignment$ cat file1.txt`

c) Directory Management:
a. Create a new directory named "docs" inside the "LinuxAssignment" directory.
Ans
`cdac@Saket:~/LinuxAssignment$ mkdir docs`
`cdac@Saket:~/LinuxAssignment$ ls`
`docs  file1.txt`
`cdac@Saket:~/LinuxAssignment$ cd docs/`
`cdac@Saket:~/LinuxAssignment/docs$`
![[Pasted image 20250226214126.png]]

d) Copy and Move Files:
a. Copy the "file1.txt" file into the "docs" directory and rename it to "file2.txt".
Ans:-
`cdac@Saket:~/LinuxAssignment$ ls`
`docs  file1.txt`
`cdac@Saket:~/LinuxAssignment$ cp file1.txt docs`
`cdac@Saket:~/LinuxAssignment$ cd docs/`
`cdac@Saket:~/LinuxAssignment/docs$ ls`
`file1.txt`
`cdac@Saket:~/LinuxAssignment/docs$ mv file1.txt file2.txt`
`cdac@Saket:~/LinuxAssignment/docs$ ls`
`file2.txt`
`cdac@Saket:~/LinuxAssignment/docs$`
![[Pasted image 20250226215722.png]]

e) Permissions and Ownership:
a. Change the permissions of "file2.txt" to allow read, write, and execute permissions for the owner and only read permissions for others. Then, change the owner of "file2.txt" to the current user.
Ans:-
`cdac@Saket:~/LinuxAssignment$ cd docs/`
`cdac@Saket:~/LinuxAssignment/docs$ chmod 744 file2.txt`
`cdac@Saket:~/LinuxAssignment/docs$ ls -l`
`total 4`
`-rwxr--r-- 1 cdac cdac 33 Feb 26 16:25 file2.txt`
`cdac@Saket:~/LinuxAssignment/docs$ chown $(whoami) file2.txt`
`cdac@Saket:~/LinuxAssignment/docs$ ls -l file2.txt`
`-rwxr--r-- 1 cdac cdac 33 Feb 26 16:25 file2.txt`
`cdac@Saket:~/LinuxAssignment/docs$`


![[Pasted image 20250226232125.png]]

f) Final Checklist:
a. Finally, list the contents of the "LinuxAssignment" directory and the root directory to
ensure that all operations were performed correctly.

## Problem 2: Read the instructions carefully and answer accordingly. If there is any need to insert some data then do that as well.

a. Suppose you have a file named "data.txt" containing important information. Display the
first 10 lines of this file to quickly glance at its contents using a command.
`cdac@Saket:~$ cd LinuxAssignment/`
`cdac@Saket:~/LinuxAssignment$ ls`
`docs  docs.zip  docs1  file1.txt`
`cdac@Saket:~/LinuxAssignment$ touch data.txt`
`cdac@Saket:~/LinuxAssignment$ nano data.txt`
`cdac@Saket:~/LinuxAssignment$ head -10 data.txt`
`apple, blue, 27, dog, mountain`
`sun, red, 12, cat, river`
`book, green, 45, bird, forest`
