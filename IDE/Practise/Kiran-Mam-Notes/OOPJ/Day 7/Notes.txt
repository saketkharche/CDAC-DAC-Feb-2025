Day 7: Object Oriented Programming Concepts of Java
Date : 10-March-2025
-----------------------------------------

Topics: 
	- Abstraction
	- Abstract class
	- Interface
	- Encapsulation
	- Inheritance
	
	
	
Abstraction:
------------
-Abstraction is an OOP principle that hides implementation details and 
shows only the essential features of an object.

Purpose:
---------
	-Simplifies the complexity
	-Reduces the code complexity
	-Increases the maintainability ans security.
	
Ways:
------
1. By using abstract class ('abstract' keyword)(100%: not necessary)
2. Using interfaces('interface' keyword)(100%)

Abstract class:
Ex: 

abstract class Shape{
	//Method declaration
	abstract double area();//Abstract method : No body for method
	
	//Method defination
	void display(){//Concreate method -Method body content 
		System.out.println("Printing: shape area");
	}
}

Ex:
abstract class  Employee{
	int id;
	String name;
	
	Employee(int id, String name){
	
		this.id = id;
		this,name = name;
		}
	abstract void calculateSalary();
	final static show(){
		System.out.println("Static method");
	}
	
	void display(){
		System.out.println("Id : "+id+" "+"Name :"+name);
	}
}

Ex:
abstract class Animal{
	abstract void sound();//withou implementation
	
	void display(){ //Non abstract method
		System.out.println("Id : "+id+" "+"Name :"+name);
	}
}


class Dog extends Animal{
	void sound(){
		System.out.println("Printing: Animal sound");
	}
	
}

Rule:
-can have constructors, static method and final methods
-used to provide common functionalities to multiple classes.

Rule 1: Abstract Methods can be declared in Abstract classes
Rule 2: If a subclass doen not implement an abstract method, then it must be declared abstract.

Ex: abstract class Dog extends Animal{
	abstract void eat();
}

Reference :
1.
Employee e = new Employee();

2. 
Employee e = null;

3.
Employee e = new childclass();

Interface:
---------------
-It is a blue print of class.
-By default, all methods in an interface are abstract and public (Java 7)
-In Java 8: 
	-Default methods : (default keyword) with implementation.
	-Static methods
-In Java 9:
	-private methods: in interfaces are allowed
	
Syntax:
interface Vehicle{
	void drive();// Abstract method
	default void speed(){//Non-abstract method
		System.out.println("Speed: Vehicle");
	}
}

Encapsulation:
----------------
-That binds data members and member function(methods) into a single unit,
where we are hiding the internal implementation details and 
providing controlled access through public methods.

-Restrict direct access to data members.
-Provides getter and setter methods to access and modify private data
-It ensures data hiding and data security.
-It improves on code reusability and modularity.


How to implement Encapsulation:
--------------------------------
1. Decalre instance variable as private
2. Providing getter and setter methods to access and modify
 the private varibles
3. By implementing data validations within setter methods.

	
Inheritance:
-----------------
-Inheritance is a mechanism in Java where a class (child class/sub class/derived class) acquires properties and behavior (fields and methods) from another class(parent class/super class/base class)
-code reusability, hierarchical organization, and polymorphism.
-Represents an IS-A relationship
	Ex: Bike(child class) IS-A(relationship) Vehicle(Parent class)
-Helps to avoid redundant code by reusing common functionality.


Terminologies:
--------------
Class: blueprint for creating object
Super class: (Parent class)
	-The class whose properties are inherited.
Sub class: (child class)
	-The class that inherits properties from another class.
	
Reusability:Using existing methods and fields of a superclass in a subclass.

EX:
class Parent{
	//Fields and methods
}
class Child extends Parent {
	//Fields and methods: Parent
	//Additional fields and methods: Child
}


Types of Inheritance:
----------------------
1. Single Inheritance
2. Multilevel Inheritance
3. Hierarchical Inheritance
----------------------------
4. Multiple Inheritance
5. Hybrid Inheritance

Multiple Inheritance : Not supported in Java:
-------------------------------------------------
class A{
	void msg(){
		SOP("A");
	}
}

class B{
	void msg(){
		SOP("B");
	}
}

/*class C extends A, B{
	
}
class Test{
	public static void main(String aregs[]){
		C c1 = new C();
		c1.msg();//Error : CE : Ambiguty
	}
}
*/

Solution: Use interfaces for multiple inheritance

Interfaces:
-------------
-An interface in Java is a blueprint of a class.
-It contains only abstract methods and constants by default (before Java 8).
-It cannot have a method body, only method declarations.
-Interfaces are used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance.
-Java 8: Interfaces can have default and static methods.
-Java 9: Interfaces can have private methods.

Why to use interfaces in Java to:
------------------------------------
-Achieve abstraction
-Enable multiple inheritance (behavior)
-Support loose coupling & polymorphism
-Create standard contracts
-Allow flexible implementations
-Make code scalable, maintainable, and extensible

Interface defination include:
--------------------------------
interface CDAC{
	// constant variable
	int CONSTANT =100;//Implicitly public, static, final
	
	//abstract methods
	void abstractMethod();
	
	//default method Java 8+:
	default void show(){
		System.out.println("Default method");
	}
	
	//static method
	static void display(){
		System.out.println("Static method");
	}
	
	//private method
	private void showbuddy(){
		System.out.println("Private method");
	}
}

Multiple Inheritane by using interfaces:
-----------------------------------------

Java 8+: Lamba expression, Stream API

Functional interfaces:
-------------------------
-'@FunctionalInterface' used as annotation in decalaration of functional interfaces
-used for Lamba expression and Stream API
Such interfaces can be designed with exactly one abstract method.

Ex:
@FunctionalInterface
interface Hello{
	void sayHello(String name);
}

Relationships (Associations:)
-----------------
IS-A: Inheriatnce
-IS-A relationship is established through inheritance, where subclass inherits properties and behaviour from super class.
-use 'extends' keyword

HAS-A: Aggregation
-HAS-A relationship(aggregation) occurs when one class contains an object of another class.

Ex:
Programmer IS-A Employee. (inheritance)
Employee HAS-A Address.


Aggregation:
-------------
IS-A relationship (Inheritance) is not valid, but HAS-A relationship.
when an object contains another object as a part of its data.


Association:
-------------
-It represents the relationship between 2 separate classes that are related but can exist independently.
-Type: 
	-One-one
	-one-many
	-many-one
	-many-many
