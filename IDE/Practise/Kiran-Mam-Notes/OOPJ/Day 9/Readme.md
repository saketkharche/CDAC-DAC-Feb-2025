### **Java Implementation Question: Simple Inheritance with Flower Example**
  
#### **Problem Statement:**  
Create a **base class (`Flower`)** that contains common properties such as:  
- `name` (flower's name)  
- `color` (flower's color)  
- `hasFragrance` (whether the flower has a fragrance or not)  

Then, create **two subclasses (`Rose` and `Lily`)** that inherit properties from `Flower` and add their own specific characteristics:  
1. **`Rose` class** should have an extra property `hasThorns` (to check if the rose has thorns).  
2. **`Lily` class** should have an extra property `isWaterPlant` (to check if the lily grows in water).  

Write a Java program that allows creating objects of `Rose` and `Lily`, setting their properties, and displaying the details.  


### **Sample Input & Output:**
#### **Input:**  
The program should create a `Rose` and a `Lily` object with the following properties:  
- Rose: **Red, has fragrance, has thorns**  
- Lily: **White, has fragrance, grows in water**  

#### **Output:**  
```
---- Rose Details ----
Flower Name: Rose
Color: Red
Has Fragrance: Yes
Has Thorns: Yes

---- Lily Details ----
Flower Name: Lily
Color: White
Has Fragrance: Yes
Grows in Water: Yes
```
