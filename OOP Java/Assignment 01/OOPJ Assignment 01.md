### 3. What is the Difference Between Compiled and Interpreted Languages? Where Does Java Fit In?  
| **Compiled Languages**                                              | **Interpreted Languages**                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Converts the entire source code into machine code before execution. | Converts and executes code line-by-line at runtime. |
| Faster execution.                                                   | Slower execution due to real-time interpretation.   |
| Examples: **C, C++**.                                               | Examples: **Python, JavaScript**.                   |

#### ðŸ”¹ **Where Does Java Fit In?**  
Java is **both compiled and interpreted**:  
- **Compiled** â†’ Java code is first compiled into **bytecode** using the `javac` compiler.  
- **Interpreted** â†’ The **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)** interprets the bytecode and runs it on any OS.  

Thus, Java achieves a **balance between speed and portability**.

## Part 3: Data Types in Java

### 1. Explain the importance of data types in Java.
Data types in Java define the **type of values** that a variable can store. They are essential for **memory management, data integrity, and type safety**.


### 2. Differentiate between primitive and non-primitive data types.
- **Primitive Data Types**: Basic types such as `int`, `char`, and `boolean`. Stored directly in memory.
    
- **Non-Primitive Data Types**: Objects, arrays, and classes. They reference memory locations instead of storing values directly.


### 3. List and briefly describe the eight primitive data types in Java.
Java has eight primitive data types:

|           |         |               |                                            |
| --------- | ------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Data Type | Size    | Default Value | Description                                |
| `byte`    | 1 byte  | 0             | Stores small integers (-128 to 127)        |
| `short`   | 2 bytes | 0             | Stores larger integers (-32,768 to 32,767) |
| `int`     | 4 bytes | 0             | Default integer type (-2^31 to 2^31-1)     |
| `long`    | 8 bytes | 0L            | Large integer values (-2^63 to 2^63-1)     |
| `float`   | 4 bytes | 0.0f          | Single-precision decimal numbers           |
| `double`  | 8 bytes | 0.0d          | Double-precision decimal numbers           |
| `char`    | 2 bytes | '\u0000'      | Stores single characters (Unicode)         |
| `boolean` | 1 bit   | false         | Represents true/false values               |


### 4. Provide examples of how to declare and initialize different data types.
```
int number = 10;
float pi = 3.14f;
char letter = 'A';
boolean isJavaFun = true;
```


### 5. What is type casting in Java? Explain with an example.
Type casting is converting one data type into another. It is categorized as:

- **Implicit Casting (Widening Conversion)**: Automatic conversion from smaller to larger types.
    
- **Explicit Casting (Narrowing Conversion)**: Manual conversion from larger to smaller types.
    

Example:

```
int num = 100;
double doubleNum = num; // Implicit casting

double decimal = 99.99;
int intNum = (int) decimal; // Explicit casting
```


### 6. Discuss the concept of wrapper classes and their usage in Java.
Wrapper classes allow primitive types to be used as objects. Examples include `Integer`, `Double`, and `Boolean`.

Example:

```
int num = 10;
Integer obj = Integer.valueOf(num); // Wrapping
int newNum = obj.intValue(); // Unwrapping
```


### 7. What is the difference between static and dynamic typing? Where does Java stand?
- **Static Typing**: Variable types are checked at **compile-time** (Java, C++).
    
- **Dynamic Typing**: Types are checked at **runtime** (Python, JavaScript).
    

Java is **statically typed**, meaning all variables must be declared with a specific type before use.

## Part 4: Java Development Kit (JDK)

### 1. What is JDK? How does it differ from JRE and JVM?

The **Java Development Kit (JDK)** is a software development kit that includes everything needed to develop and run Java applications. It differs from:

- **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**: Runs Java bytecode but does not include development tools.
    
- **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**: Includes the JVM and libraries to run Java programs but lacks development tools.
    

### 2. Explain the main components of JDK.

- **Java Compiler (**`**javac**`**)**: Converts Java source code into bytecode.
    
- **Java Runtime (**`**java**`**)**: Executes Java applications.
    
- **Java Libraries**: Pre-built classes and functions.
    
- **Debugger (**`**jdb**`**)**: Helps debug Java programs.
    
- **Javadoc Tool (**`**javadoc**`**)**: Generates documentation from comments.
    

### 3. Describe the steps to install JDK and configure Java on your system.

1. Download the latest JDK from the [official Oracle/OpenJDK website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
    
2. Install it following the on-screen instructions.
    
3. Set the `PATH` variable to include the `bin` directory.
    
4. Verify installation using:
    
    ```
    java -version
    javac -version
    ```
    

### 4. Write a simple Java program to print "Hello, World!" and explain its structure.

```
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

- `public class HelloWorld`: Defines the class.
    
- `public static void main(String[] args)`: Entry point of the program.
    
- `System.out.println()`: Prints output.
    

### 5. What is the significance of the PATH and CLASSPATH environment variables in Java?

- **PATH**: Specifies directories containing executable files like `javac` and `java`.
    
- **CLASSPATH**: Specifies directories containing Java class files and libraries.
    

### 6. What are the differences between OpenJDK and Oracle JDK?

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Feature|OpenJDK|Oracle JDK|
|**License**|Open-source (GPL)|Commercial|
|**Support**|Community-driven|Oracle support|
|**Updates**|Frequent|LTS versions available|

### 7. Explain how Java programs are compiled and executed.

1. **Write** Java code.
    
2. **Compile** using `javac` to generate bytecode (`.class` file).
    
3. **Execute** using `java`, which runs it on the JVM.
    

### 8. What is Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, and how does it improve Java performance?

JIT compilation converts bytecode into native machine code **at runtime**, improving execution speed by optimizing frequently used code.

### 9. Discuss the role of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) in program execution.

The **JVM** runs Java applications by:

- **Interpreting bytecode**.
    
- **Managing memory** with garbage collection.
    
- **Ensuring security** through sandboxing.
